## **Concepts**

A **citizen** is a person who is a member of a political unit such as a nation-state.

An **organization** is a grouping of citizens.

- A citizen can be a member of one or more organizations.
- An organization can be as small as two members or as large as the whole population of a nation-state. 
- Organizations may, optionally, participate in parent-child relationships.
- An organization can have at most one **parent organization** and any number of **sub-organizations**.

A **responsibility** is a specific *class of work* that an organization is responsible for performing and accountable for completing.

A **task** is a specific *work item* that needs to be completed by one or more organization members as part of fulfilling some responsibility of their organization.
