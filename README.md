Praja - software for people-powered governance!

## People & Organizations

A **person** can team-up with other people to form an **organization**. The same person can be a member of multiple organizations.

An organization has a **purpose**. Members of the organization carry out **tasks** in the service of that purpose.

Organizations may, optionally, participate in parent-child relationships. An organization can have at most one **parent organization** and any number of **sub-organizations**.

An organization may be as small as just two people or as large as all the people in a nation-state.
